    <h2> Skills </h2>
    <p>Here are my skills that I’ve worked hard to curate and tone.</p>
    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <p>I have extremely strong writing skills. I have a lot of experience in both technical writing and creative writing.</p>

    <p>I also have strong design skills. I am proficient using Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop, as well as Microsoft Office products.</p>

    <h3>Editing/Proofreading</h3>
    <p>I have a natural affinity for grammar, and a very sharp attention to detail. I’ve taken an in-depth course in grammar and proofreading (Grammar for Professionals).</p>

    <h3> Communication </h3>
    <p>After 2020, I have become very proficient in online communication, through email and video meetings specifically. I have experience in both internal and external communication.</p>

    <h3> Basic Web Development </h3>
    <p>I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS programming. For example, I designed and built this website from scratch.</p>

    <h2> Qualities </h2>
    <p> Here are my qualities that make me an exceptional technical writer. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Articulate </li>
      <li> Attention to detail </li>
      <li> Determined and focused</li>
      <li> Great time management </li>
      <li> Organized </li>

    </ul>

    <h2> Experience </h2>
    <p> Most of my experience comes from classes and internships. </p>

    <h3> Internship </h3>
    <p>I am currently working as a technical writing intern with Get Lit! Festival. I have worked on many different technical documents, designing flyers, communicating with authors, and helped facilitate Zoom events.</p>

    <h3> Instructions </h3>
    <p> I am currently working on developing instructions for Eastern Washignton University students to use Virtual Labs. This includes research, taking screenshots, writing, and revising the instructions.</p>

    <h3>Web Development</h3>
    <p>I designed this website from scratch. I wrote the content, designed the layout, and wrote all of the code (HTML and CSS).</p>

    <h3>Web Writing</h3>
    <p>I worked with Eastern Washington University’s Sustainability department to write and design a webpage about Regional Freshwater Sources. This included researching, interviewing experts, writing a recommendation report, and writing and designing the webpage itself. This was an independent project, meaning I did not work with a group of classmates.</p>

    <h3>More Instructions</h3>
