    <p>Hello! My name is Anna Pearsall. I am a writer and a college student.</p>

    <p>I’m currently attending Eastern Washington University, where I plan to graduate with my Bachelors of Art in Technical Communication in the Spring of 2022.</p>

    <p>I enjoy creating and appreciating art in all forms, be it words or visual. I aim to create visually appealing and usable information through my technical writing, while also developing my creative work. My main inspiration comes from nature, and I am greatly influenced by the Pacific Northwest.</p>

    <p>When I’m not working on assignments, writing, or reading, I am outdoors. I love hiking, skiing, kayaking, and just being outdoors and appreciating nature.</p>
