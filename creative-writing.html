    <h2> Accomplishments </h2>
    <p>5-time NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) winner (2016-2020)</p>
    <p>2019 Silver Medal Winner of the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards in the Novel Writing division</p>
    <p>2018 3rd place winner in the Norm Strung Youth Writing Awards in the Senior Prose division</p>
    <p>2017 runner up in the Spokesman Review Outdoor Writing Contest </p>

    <h2> Writing Process </h2>
    <p> I try to write every single day. To accomplish this, I wake up at 6:00 am, when I start my writing routine. </p>

    <p>This includes reading a poem, reading something about writing itself, and then freewriting. After, I find an exercise or other writing prompt. I do this all in a cheap spiral bound notebook, with my Pilot Metropolitan fountain pen. </p>

    <p>Then, I’ll switch over to my computer. This is when I work on my big projects. If it’s November, I’ll be writing away, trying to fit in the 1700 words a day for NaNoWriMo. If it’s in the winter or early spring, I’ll probably be working on different short stories. In late spring and summer, I’m in the revision process for the novel I wrote the last year. </p>

    <p> I’ll typically work for an hour or two, before starting the rest of my day of classes. </p>
