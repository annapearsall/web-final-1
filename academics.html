    <p>I am currently a junior at Eastern Washington University, studying Technical Communications with a minor in Creative Writing.</p>

    <p> I started at Eastern when I was 15 by attending a dual-enrollment program called Running Start. Now, I am ready to graduate in the spring of 2022 at the age of 19. </p>

    <p>I have a GPA of 3.97. I work tirelessly in all of my classes to ensure that not only am I earning high grades, but that I am learning and preparing as much as possible for after graduation, as well as connecting with people in my area of study.</p>

    <p>I graduated from Mount Spokane High School in the year 2020, with a GPA of 3.94 and two years of college credit.</p>
